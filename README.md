# 🧖 Spa Center Performance & Incentive Risk Analytics
### **3‑Year Operational Analysis (2023–2025)**  
*Dashboard & Metrics Built Using Tableau*

This project analyzes sales performance, commission structure, employee dependency, operational risk, and incentive efficiency for a spa center over a 3‑year period.

The goal is to understand:

- Revenue growth sustainability  
- Commission payout efficiency  
- Employee dependency risks  
- Performance stability  
- Profitability drivers

# 📊 **Dashboard Overview**

### **Main Dashboard**
![Dashboard](Dashboard%201.png)

# 🔍 **Core Analytical Matrices**

## **1️⃣ Efficiency Matrix (Sales ÷ Commission)**  
This metric evaluates how much sales revenue is generated for each Riyal of commission paid.

- **> 5 = Very Efficient**  
- **Around 5 = Normal Efficiency**  
- **< 5 = Overpayment Risk**

## **2️⃣ Incentive Risk Matrix**

### **A. Commission Dependency**
Formula:  
**Employee commission ÷ Total commission**

This metric detects reliance on a small group of employees.

### **B. Commission Volatility Index (CV)**  
Formula:  
**Standard Deviation ÷ Average Commission**

Used to measure how stable or unstable employee commission payouts are.

High volatility may indicate:
- Inconsistent performance  
- Incentive design issues  
- Operational risk

# 🧼 Data Handling Notes

Nulls were converted to **zeros** before calculations to ensure accurate matrix values.

# 🎯 **Challenge (for GitHub Users)**

> **Can you answer the business questions *using only the visuals* above — without any written explanation?**

Try to interpret the dashboard and solve these questions:

1. **Does the spa center rely heavily on a few employees for sales?**  
2. **Is the commission payment system efficient or showing signs of overpayment?**

This project is designed so the insights can be inferred directly from the diagrams.
